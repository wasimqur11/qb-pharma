### 🌐 Server Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Static File Server (Recommended)
1. Copy the entire `dist/` folder to your web server
2. Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for production

#### Option 2: Apache Server
```apache
# .htaccess file in dist/ directory
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

#### Option 3: Nginx Server
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /path/to/dist;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Enable gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/javascript application/json;
}
```
