# QB Pharma System Improvements Summary

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. Crowded Navigation Menu ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Menu items were getting crowded with too many tabs in a single row.

**Solution**: 
- Reorganized navigation with logical grouping and color-coded categories
- **Dashboards**: Pharmacy (Blue), Doctor (Blue), Analytics (Blue)
- **Management**: Stakeholders (Green), Patients (Green)  
- **Reports**: Reports (Purple), Statements (Purple)
- **Settings**: Configuration (Orange)
- Added sub-navigation for statement types to reduce main navigation clutter
- Implemented horizontal scrolling with hidden scrollbar for mobile responsiveness
- Added visual separators between category groups

### 2. Department Loading Issue in Employee Form ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Departments were not loading from the Department Management system when adding employees.

**Solution**:

## üìä Validation Status Report

### ‚úÖ Fully Validated Features:
- Email validation (optional/required handling)
- Indian mobile number formatting and validation  
- Currency amount validation
- Patient credit limit validation
